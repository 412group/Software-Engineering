### GITHUB TIPS

- If you don't know how to do something, ask chatGPT for directions.
- Example questions you might want to ask:
    - "how to create an angular component for a beginner developer"
    - "how to write a backend route for a FAQ page"

TO WORK ON FRONTEND:
- go to adopt-me-app > frontend > src > app
- cd inside the app folder and create a component by typing `ng generate component <name-of-your-component>`
- idea of components we will need, feel free to improvise:
    - search bar
    - primary navigation bar
    - auth: login, registration
    - pages: home, browse, pet profile, user library, FAQ
    - chatbot
- to check your progress and peek at your webpage, do `ng serve`
- [guide to angular components](https://angular.io/guide/component-overview)

TO WORK ON BACKEND:
- go to adopt-me-app > backend
