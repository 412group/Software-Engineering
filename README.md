### GITHUB TIPS

- Maintain a branch with your name
- Whenever you want to submit your changes so that the rest of the group can see, you need to push your changes to your branch, then merge your branch with main. To do this, you will need to select "create & pull request" in github, press the create button, then once created press the "merge" button. Now the whole group will be able to see your updates on the main branch.
